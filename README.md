# Real-time Smart Health Monitoring Desc
Real-time Smart Health Monitoring System is a system that is commonly used to monitor the actual condition of patients in hospitals. The application of this instrument aims to make it easier to monitor the condition of patients who are infected with the Covid-19 virus. This system can prevent the spread of COVID-19 by reducing the intensity of direct contact between medical personnel and COVID-19 positive patients. Thus, medical personnel can still monitor the health conditions of positive COVID-19 patients without the need to carry out special procedures to carry out special examinations so as to increase the work efficiency of medical personnel. The device for patients working with ESP32 reads patient parameters such as temperature, oxygen saturation, and heart rate by the MAX30102 sensor. Furthermore, the read data will be sent to another ESP32 which is also on the patient to be displayed in the Web Server. In addition, the data is also sent to devices located by medical personnel with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Thus, medical personnel can monitor data on positive COVID-19 patients in real time and can then analyze the progress of the data received.
